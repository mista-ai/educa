- **Real-Time Communication:** Enable chat functionality within courses using the integrated chat server.
- **API Access:** Utilize the RESTful API to extend platform functionality or integrate with other services.
- **Performance Optimization:** Benefit from caching mechanisms via Memcached and Redis for faster content delivery.

## Production Setup

- **NGINX & uWSGI:** NGINX is used as a reverse proxy to serve the Django application via uWSGI.
- **Daphne & WebSockets:** Daphne handles WebSocket connections for real-time features.
- **SSL/TLS:** Secure the platform with SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Docker:** The entire platform is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
